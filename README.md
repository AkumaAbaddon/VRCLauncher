   <h2>Features</h2>
   <p>
   - VR/Desktop Mode switch, easily change change from vr to desktop mode and vise versa.
   - Close EAC automatically when launching the game with the Launcher.
   - Un/Cap FPS to 60, 90, 120, 999
   - Delete VRChat Content Download Chache automatically when launching.
   - Bullshit Closer, closes programs/processes you list inside the BSC window.
   - VRChat priority changer, switch between the default and high priority.
   
   Majority of these functions are created to lower the amount of work the user has to do to get the most out of the game.
   Functions like Empty VRC-Chache can fix certain lag spikes, Bullshit Closer can help to gain more FPS with weak CPUs, and more.
   The program has been tested a lot in the last days and performed very well, in case you do encounter a bug let me know.
